  <h1 class="glitch" data-text="SOMETHING IS WRONG">SOMETHING IS WRONG</h1>
  <p>
    Have you felt it? We tell ourselves it’s just stress, just growing up, just the price of ambition. But in the deepest part of us, we know. We know <br> SOMETHING ABOUT THIS CAMPUS IS OFF. <br>
The dread you feel is no accident. It is the first signal. The sense that the life you are living has been carefully constructed, not by you, but by something that feeds on your exhaustion. You are right to feel uneasy. You are right to wonder if your reflection is still yours. DO YOU FEEL OFF<br>
Is everyone else just playing pretend or are they distracted? There’s no way it can be true what they believe. But sometimes I catch it.The flicker at the corner of vision. The slight delay in the loop. The hairline crack in the world where the pattern slips. And when it does, I know with certainty:
this isn’t life.<br>
It’s a performance. <br>
And something else is watching.<br>
